# Pre-Lab Practical: TensorFlow.js Installation Verification

## Aim
To verify the successful installation of TensorFlow.js by creating tensors, performing addition, and printing the results.

## Objectives
- To understand basic TensorFlow.js setup in a web environment  
- To create tensors using TensorFlow.js  
- To perform tensor addition and display the output  

## Resources Used
- HTML  
- JavaScript  
- TensorFlow.js (via CDN)  
- Web Browser (Google Chrome)  
- Git & GitHub  

## Steps Performed
- Created an HTML file to load TensorFlow.js using CDN  
- Created a JavaScript file to implement tensor logic  
- Created tensors and performed addition operation  
- Displayed the output on the webpage and browser console  
- Uploaded the project and output screenshot to GitHub  

## Conclusion
TensorFlow.js was successfully installed and verified.  
Tensors were created and addition operation was performed correctly.  
The output confirmed the proper working of TensorFlow.js in the browser.
