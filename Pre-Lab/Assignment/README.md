# Assignment: Tensor Operations Using TensorFlow.js

## Assignment Tasks
1. Create tensors of different dimensions (scalar, vector, matrix)  
2. Perform element-wise addition and multiplication on vectors  
3. Demonstrate tensor reshaping and explain reshape() vs flatten()  

## Objectives
- To understand different tensor dimensions  
- To perform mathematical operations on tensors  
- To learn tensor reshaping techniques in TensorFlow.js  

## Steps Followed
- Created scalar, vector, and matrix tensors  
- Performed element-wise addition and multiplication on vectors  
- Applied reshape() and flatten() operations  
- Displayed outputs sequentially on a web page  

## Difference Between reshape() and flatten()

| Feature | reshape() | flatten() |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Purpose | Changes tensor shape | Converts tensor to 1-D |
| Output Dimension | User-defined | Always 1-D |
| Data Order | Preserved | Preserved |
| Use Case | Required specific shape | Required linear tensor |
| Example | 2×3 → 3×2 | 2×3 → 1×6 |

## Conclusion
The assignment successfully demonstrated tensor operations using TensorFlow.js.  
Different tensor dimensions and vector operations were performed correctly.  
The difference between reshape() and flatten() was clearly understood.
