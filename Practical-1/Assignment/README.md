# Assignments: Linear Regression with Synthetic Data (TensorFlow.js)

This folder contains **three assignments** based on Linear Regression using
TensorFlow.js executed entirely in the browser using JavaScript.

---

## Assignment 1: Actual vs Predicted Analysis
### Objective
- Train a linear regression model on synthetic data
- Plot **Actual vs Predicted values**
- Analyze model accuracy using MSE and regression equation

### Output
- Line graph comparing actual data points and predicted line
- Equation of trained model
- Console logs for training and prediction

---

## Assignment 2: Learning Rate & Convergence Analysis
### Objective
- Train the same regression model with different learning rates
- Observe and compare convergence behavior

### Output
- Loss vs Epoch graph for multiple learning rates
- Console output showing epoch-wise loss
- Analysis of fast, slow, and stable convergence

---

## Assignment 3: Prediction on Unseen Inputs
### Objective
- Use the trained regression model to predict unseen inputs
- Compare predicted results with expected values

### Output
- Input field and prediction button
- Table showing Input, Expected, Predicted, and Error (%)
- Console output of prediction values

---

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js (CDN)
- HTML5
- Chart.js (for visualization)

---

## Conclusion
All three assignments demonstrate the practical implementation of Linear
Regression using TensorFlow.js without any backend or Node.js. Visualization and
console outputs help in better understanding model behavior and performance.
